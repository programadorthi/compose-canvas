# Compose Desktop Canvas [in progress...]
A [SkiaSharp tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/graphics/skiasharp/) built using Jetpack Compose

## With great power comes great responsibility
The project mix Compose DrawScope and Skija NativeCanvas to create versions showing when we can use DrawScope directly or manage NativeCanvas that is more powerful.

## Warning
1. The project is in Compose Desktop but only Native Canvas calls changes between Android version and must work in same way
2. All samples are just a rewrite showing how you can to draw using Jetpack Compose
3. Optimization are not the goal here. If you find any performance issue please open an issues or pull requests are welcome
